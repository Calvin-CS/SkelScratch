# SkelScratch Installation Instructions

***Preinstallation notes***

SkelScratch requires Windows 8 or newer. Windows 10 has not been tested.  
SkelScratch supports Chrome and Firefox, and does not support Internet Explorer. Other browsers are untested.

***Installation Instructions***

Plug your Kinect into your PC.  
Make sure your Kinect is plugged in to a USB 3.0 port.

SkelScratch exists in two parts: A server that reads from the Kinect, and a client that connects to the server in ScratchX.

Part 1: Downloading and installing the server.

Go to <a href="https://github.com/visor841/Kinect2JSON/releases" target="_blank">Kinect2JSON</a>.  
Go to the downloads section next to "Latest release".  
Click on the "Kinect2JSON.zip" link. Save the file.  
Go to your downloads folder and right-click on "Kinect2JSON.zip", and click "Extract All...", and then click "Extract" in the bottom right.  
Double-click on setup.

A window will come up saying "Windows protected your PC". ***Don't click on "OK".*** Click "More info", then click "Run anyway".  
A box will come up saying "Application Install - Security Warning". Click "Install".  
A window will come up saying "Windows protected your PC". ***Don't click on "OK"*** Click "More info", then click "Run anyway".  
A window will popup about "Windows Security Alert". Check the box next to "Public networks", then click "allow access".

The server will now launch.  It might take a minute. Be patient.

(If you need to launch the program later, go to the start screen, and type in "Kinect2JSON", and hit enter.)

Part 2: Launch

Go to <a href="http://www.scratchx.org/?url=http://visor841.github.io/SkelScratch/SkelScratch.js#scratch" target="_blank">scratchx</a>.   
Click "Ok", "I understand, continue", and "Ok".  
If you see a bunch of blocks show up, congratulations, SkelScratch is now loaded!

***Troubleshooting***

The client connects to port 8181.
